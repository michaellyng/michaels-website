<p>the imopster had a suit with a long red tie and a plant pot for a hat he wore an almost perfect resemblment to the others but he was dressed in a blue costume he had a smirk that resembled the grin of death he would run round and creep through the vents of the ship he would sneak up behind you and you would see the grin and that would be the last thing you would see.
